## Design
The Learning Project of 2017 Winter involved 3 teams coming up with ideas on how we can make the trashcans at uOttawa, fully autonomous. We had 3 different teams with at least 8 people. 

The following design (Recbots) won the criteria created by the Stakeholders: 


Some of the following things have been suggested:
A gutter system inside the garbage to handle wet trash
A separate compartment for liquids (Not in the middle)
Funnel for liquids will be places left of the conveyer belt
The tube will be connected to the gutter system
Ramps will be tilted slightly upwards to allow for liquid flow
A conveyer belt on the top for separation of more than 1 item. 
The conveyer belt will have raised *fins* to provide user guidance on where to place items (Think of ways to not always make it run)
Moving the box higher to provide higher ramp 
Box has to be a bit lower than top of trash so items don’t roll out
The ramp will be moved to the left so that the box’s trap can be dropped vertically
45 degrees down if trash needs to be in another bin
The ramps will be pushed up with the servos to allow an item to fall in
If an item will be stuck, we can explore shaking of the ramps
