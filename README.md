# Recycle-Sorter

Thank you to Jana for leading us through this project. 

Thanks to Chartwells, we have recieved funding to work on this project. 

According to the EPA, an estimated 75% of the american waste stream is recycleable, yet only 30% of it gets recycled. 
We all know climate change is one of the biggest risks to humanities survival. Unfortunatly, the world is not working fast enough to fight this problem. 
It's well known that most CO2 emmisions and energy usage comes from manufacturing, coal and natural gas. 

If the world was better at recycling products and materials, we would not have to work so hard looking for and processing raw resources. 

The recycle sorter is an autonomous garbage compartment capable of seperating different types of waste materials. 
We are part of Ottabotics, uOttawa's Robotics Team. 
We are a small team comprised of mechanical, electrical, software, computer and civil engineers. 
The Recycle Sorter was the first project for the Ottabotics Team.
The deadline for the project is September 2017
The system uses an optical and a metal sensor to detect different types of waste. 
We have been given all of the recyclables which come out of the SITE (Faculty of Engineering at uOttawa) cafetaria. We are aiming to seperate all of these waste materials. 


## Requirements: 
  ### Priority 5
    1. System should be built considering the upmost safety standards.
    2. System should be operational by persons in wheelchairs.
    3. System should be able to handle liquid waste.
    4. System should be thoroughly documented.
    5. System should handle all waste currently recycled by the GQV2 garbage compartments at the university.
    6. System should be able to seperate and put waste into rightful compartments.
    7. System should be able to waste atleast 4 different types of waste.
    
  ### Priority 4
    1. System should be able to handle wet and sticky waste.
    2. System should be easy to clean by janitorial staff.
    
  ### Priority 3
    1. System should intergrate an LCD screen.
    2. System should relay data to a website.
    3. System should provide interface to janitors.
    
  ### Priority 2
    1. System should notify janitors when bins are 75% full. 
    2. Users should not send more than 5 seconds to recycle their waste. 
    
  ### Priority 1
    1. System should be portable.
    2. System should be able to seperate waste within waste. 
  

## Challenges: 
  
  Objects within objects.
  User carrying more than one article of garbage.
  Detection of Plastic, compost and paper without the use of Computer Vision.
