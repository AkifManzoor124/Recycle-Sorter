# Recycle-Sorter

Thanks to Chartwells, we have recieved funding to work on this project. 

According to the EPA, an estimated 75% of the american waste stream is recycleable, yet only 30% of it gets recycled. 
We all know climate change is one of the biggest risks to humanities survival. Unfortunatly, the world is not working fast enough to fight this problem. 
It's well known that most CO2 emmisions and energy usage comes from manufacturing, coal and natural gas. 

If the world was better at recycling products and materials, we would not have to work so hard looking for and processing raw resources. 

The recycle sorter is an autonomous garbage compartment capable of seperating different types of waste materials. 
We are part of Ottabotics, uOttawa's Robotics Team. 
We are a small team comprised of mechanical, electrical, software, computer and civil engineers. 
The Recycle Sorter was the first project for the Ottabotics Team, University of Ottawa's Robotics Team. 
The deadline for the project is September 2017
The system uses an optical and a metal sensor to detect different types of waste. 


Challenges: 
  
  Objects within objects
  User carrying more than one article of garbage
  Detection of Plastic, compost and paper without the use of Computer Vision
